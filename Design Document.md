# Core Features

## Game Modes

Mosaic Motion features gameplay centered around the manipulation of mosaic tiles within a square board. The goal is to align the tiles, which upon puzzle initialization are scrambled, into the proper order. The player can select the method of tile manipulation through one of four "modes". Additionally, after selecting a game mode, the player will choose one of two "styles" of gameplay, which serve as win conditions.

### Standard Mode

Standard Mode presents the player with a traditional slide puzzle, where the player must slide tiles into a single "gap space" in order to set the tiles into the correct alignment.

### Twist Mode

Twist Mode demands that the player manipulate a 2x2 box around the board which allows for clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the four tiles within that box.

### Shift Mode

Shift mode gives the player two axes which can be manipulated around the board. Tiles which are in-line with the axes can be moved one space in the four cardinal directions, wrapping around when a piece would pass over the edge of the board.

### Flip Mode\*

Similarly to Shift Mode, Flip mode gives the player two axes to control and allows tiles aligned with said axes to be manipulated, however rather than being moved, the tiles are flipped completely in that direction (i.e: ABCD -> DCBA).

\* I don't know if I'm going to implement this feature at all, since I'm not sure if it would be theoretically possible to solve.

# Extra Features

If I have some extra time as the end of the project approaches, I'd love to be able to implement these! I have them organized in order of feasibility, subject to change in the future depending on how things go...
