# Core Features

## Game Modes

Mosaic Motion features gameplay centered around the manipulation of mosaic tiles within a square board. The goal is to align the tiles, which upon puzzle initialization are scrambled, into the proper order. The player can select the method of tile manipulation through one of four "modes". Additionally, after selecting a game mode, the player will choose one of two "styles" of gameplay, which serve as win conditions.

### Standard Mode

Standard Mode presents the player with a traditional slide puzzle, where the player must slide tiles into a single "gap space" in order to set the tiles into the correct alignment.

### Twist Mode

Twist Mode demands that the player manipulate a 2x2 box around the board which allows for clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the four tiles within that box.

### Shift Mode

Shift mode gives the player two axes which can be manipulated around the board. Tiles which are in-line with the axes can be moved one space in the four cardinal directions, wrapping around when a piece would pass over the edge of the board.

### Flip Mode\*

Similarly to Shift Mode, Flip mode gives the player two axes to control and allows tiles aligned with said axes to be manipulated, however rather than being moved, the tiles are flipped completely in that direction (i.e: ABCD -> DCBA).

\* I don't know if I'm going to implement this feature at all, since I haven't tested if it would be theoretically possible to solve.

## Game Styles

### Time Attack Style

In Time Attack Style, the player is required to solve as many puzzles within a given time period as possible. The player will be able to choose said period, ranging from one minute to fifteen minutes. The number of puzzles completed by the player will be recorded in the scoreboard.

### Strategist Style

In Strategist Style, the player is tasked with completing a single puzzle in both the shortest amount of time and the fewest number of operations. The player will receive a score based on how he or she performs.

## Options Menu

The options menu is the screen where players will be presented with their gameplay choices, namely which mode and style they would like to play, the difficulty of the puzzle, and which background music (if any) they want to listen to.

### Mode Select

Players decide between playing on Standard Mode, Twist Mode, Shift Mode, and Flip Mode (maybe).

### Style Select

Players decide between playing with Strategist Style or Time Attack Style. Time Attack also provides the player with a slider, allowing him or her to choose the length of the time challenge.

### Difficulty Select

Players decide between playing on Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty:
- Easy difficulty requires the player to solve a 3x3 puzzle (nine total pieces).
- Medium difficulty requires the player to solve a 4x4 puzzle (sixteen total pieces).
- Hard difficulty requires the player to solve a 6x6 puzzle (thirty-six total pieces).

### BGM Options

Players can choose which music track will play in the background during puzzle solving. Additionally, if he or she should so choose, a player can opt to turn the music off.

At present, I'd like to implement three different music tracks, but I may want to add more in the future.

# Extra Features

If I have some extra time as the end of the project approaches, I'd love to be able to implement these! I have them organized in order of feasibility, subject to change in the future depending on how things go...
