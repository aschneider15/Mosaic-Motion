# Super Tiles: "The Ultimate Sliding Tile Puzzle Game for Nintendo Game Boy!"

## Currently in development by Aidan Schneider (Absent Corner)

Thanks for checking out my project! I'm planning on finishing this around the end of 2024... minimum viable product expected by September 1.

For anyone wondering, my favorite part to work on so far has been the soundtrack! I'll be uploading oscilloscope views of the whole thing once it's finished on the Absent Corner YouTube channel, so stay tuned for that!
